* Overview
  This tool allows to collect and coarsen a surface mesh that may be
  distributed across a cluster. The communication is performed via MPI.

* Installation
  The following components are necessary to build the tool:
  - MPI :: message passing interface for distributed computing
  - VCG :: templated graph library
  - Boost :: C++ extensions
  - CMake :: A softwarebuild system

  The path of the VCG installation must be specified manually. It is the
  folder containing apps/ docs/ eigenlib/ img/ vcg/ and wrap/:
  cmake -DVCG_INCLUDE_DIR=INSERT_VCG_PATH_HERE FOLDER_OF_THIS_README

  For example
  cmake -DVCG_INCLUDE_DIR=../vcglib ../distributed-polygon-reducer

* Overview
  This tool allows to collect and coarsen a surface mesh that may be
  distributed across a cluster. The communication is performed via MPI.

* Usage
  The easiest usage is
  ./simplify-mesh input_file1.obj input_file2.obj ... -o output_file.obj

  To control the behaviour of the program see the flags presented by
  ./simplify-mesh --help

  To run the program in parallel use
  mpirun -np NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES ./simplify-mesh ARGS

  Note: Specifying more processes than input files has no beneficial effect -
  the excess processes are immediately terminated.

* Installation
  The following components are necessary to build the tool:
  - MPI :: message passing interface for distributed computing
  - VCG :: templated graph library
  - Boost :: C++ extensions
  - CMake :: A software build system

  A working copy of VCG is already included. If you want to use your own
  version instead, specify it with

  cmake -DVCG_INCLUDE_DIR=INSERT_VCG_PATH_HERE PROJECT_DIR

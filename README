* Overview
  This tool allows to collect and coarsen a surface mesh that may be
  distributed across a cluster. The communication is performed via MPI.

* Installation
  The following components are necessary to build the tool:
  - MPI :: message passing interface for distributed computing
  - VCG :: templated graph library
  - Boost :: C++ extensions
  - CMake :: A software build system

  A working copy of VCG is already included. If you want to use your own
  version instead, specify it with

  cmake -DVCG_INCLUDE_DIR=INSERT_VCG_PATH_HERE PROJECT_DIR
